# Port Conflict Detection - Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-10-28

## Problem

Deployment was failing on Ubuntu VPS (Vultr) because **Traefik reverse proxy** was already running on port 80, preventing Nginx from starting.

### User's Error:
```
Starting and enabling all services...
Job for nginx.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
```

### Root Cause Investigation:
```bash
$ sudo lsof -i :80
COMMAND     PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
traefik     959 root    7u  IPv6  10036      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)
tailscale 18897 root   18u  IPv4 158910      0t0  TCP ...
```

**Traefik** (PID 959) was already bound to port 80.

---

## Why This Happens

### Common Scenarios:

1. **VPS Pre-installed Services**
   - Vultr, DigitalOcean, Linode often pre-install Traefik or Apache
   - Port 80 occupied before deployment runs

2. **Previous Deployments**
   - Old Nginx or Apache still running
   - Zombie processes holding ports

3. **Development Tools**
   - Docker containers exposing ports
   - Other web frameworks running

4. **Proxy/Load Balancers**
   - Traefik, HAProxy, Caddy already managing traffic
   - May be intentional infrastructure setup

---

## The Fix

Added **port conflict detection** before attempting to start Nginx in both deployment scripts.

### Implementation (Lines 546-564 in both scripts):

```bash
# Check for port conflicts before starting Nginx
log "${YELLOW}Checking for port conflicts on port $NGINX_PORT...${NC}"
PORT_IN_USE=$(sudo lsof -i :$NGINX_PORT -sTCP:LISTEN -t 2>/dev/null || echo "")

if [ -n "$PORT_IN_USE" ]; then
    CONFLICTING_PROCESS=$(sudo lsof -i :$NGINX_PORT -sTCP:LISTEN | tail -n +2)
    log "${RED}✗ Port $NGINX_PORT is already in use by another process:${NC}"
    echo "$CONFLICTING_PROCESS" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
    log ""
    log "${YELLOW}Resolution options:${NC}"
    log "${YELLOW}  1. Stop the conflicting service (if safe to do so)${NC}"
    log "${YELLOW}  2. Re-run deploy.sh and choose a different port (e.g., 8080)${NC}"
    log "${YELLOW}  3. Configure Traefik/reverse proxy to forward to this application${NC}"
    log ""
    log "${RED}Deployment cannot continue with port conflict.${NC}"
    exit 1
else
    log "${GREEN}✓ Port $NGINX_PORT is available${NC}"
fi
```

### How It Works:

1. **Check port** using `lsof -i :$NGINX_PORT -sTCP:LISTEN`
2. **If occupied**: Show conflicting process details and exit with clear error
3. **If available**: Continue with Nginx startup
4. **Fail fast**: Don't attempt Nginx start if port is occupied (prevents confusing error messages)

---

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Stop Conflicting Service

**For Traefik:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop traefik
sudo systemctl disable traefik  # Prevent auto-start
sudo ./deploy.sh  # Re-run deployment
```

**For Apache:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop apache2      # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo systemctl stop httpd        # RHEL/AlmaLinux
sudo systemctl disable apache2   # Prevent auto-start
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

**For old Nginx:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo ./deploy.sh  # Will reconfigure and restart
```

---

### Option 2: Use Different Port

**Re-run deployment with custom port:**

```bash
sudo ./deploy.sh

# When prompted:
Enter Nginx public port [80]: 8080
Enter Gunicorn internal port [8000]: 8000
```

**Result:**
- Nginx listens on port 8080 (no conflict)
- Access application via `http://server-ip:8080`
- Firewall automatically configured for port 8080

---

### Option 3: Use Traefik as Frontend (Advanced)

**Keep Traefik** and configure it to forward to the Django application:

1. **Deploy Django on custom port** (e.g., 8080)
2. **Configure Traefik** to route specific domain/path to Django:

```yaml
# traefik.yml or docker-compose labels
http:
  routers:
    zkteco:
      rule: "Host(`zkteco.yourdomain.com`)"
      service: zkteco
  services:
    zkteco:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

3. **Benefits:**
   - SSL/TLS termination via Traefik
   - Multiple applications on same server
   - Advanced routing capabilities

---

## Updated Deployment Flow

### New Sequence (Step 11):

```
1. Check if port is available (lsof)
   ├─ Port free → Continue
   └─ Port occupied → Show error and exit

2. Enable Nginx service
3. Start Nginx service
4. Verify Nginx is running
5. Start Gunicorn service
6. Verify Gunicorn is running
7. Start Django-Q service
8. Verify Django-Q is running
```

### Previous Behavior (Before Fix):

```
1. Enable Nginx service
2. Start Nginx service → FAILS with cryptic error
3. systemctl status shows bind() error
4. User must manually investigate
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/opt/CCP/zktecoMGMT/deploy_debian.sh`

**Before** (Lines 505-507):
```bash
log "${YELLOW}Starting and enabling all services...${NC}"

# Enable and start Nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

**After** (Lines 505-527):
```bash
log "${YELLOW}Starting and enabling all services...${NC}"

# Check for port conflicts before starting Nginx
log "${YELLOW}Checking for port conflicts on port $NGINX_PORT...${NC}"
PORT_IN_USE=$(sudo lsof -i :$NGINX_PORT -sTCP:LISTEN -t 2>/dev/null || echo "")

if [ -n "$PORT_IN_USE" ]; then
    # [Show error and exit]
else
    log "${GREEN}✓ Port $NGINX_PORT is available${NC}"
fi

# Enable and start Nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Clean System (Port 80 Free)

```bash
sudo ./deploy.sh

# Output:
Starting and enabling all services...
Checking for port conflicts on port 80...
✓ Port 80 is available
✓ Nginx service is running
✓ Gunicorn service is running
✓ Django-Q2 service is running
```

---

### Test Case 2: Port Conflict (Traefik Running)

```bash
sudo ./deploy.sh

# Output:
Starting and enabling all services...
Checking for port conflicts on port 80...
✗ Port 80 is already in use by another process:
COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
traefik   959 root    7u  IPv6  10036      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)

Resolution options:
  1. Stop the conflicting service (if safe to do so)
  2. Re-run deploy.sh and choose a different port (e.g., 8080)
  3. Configure Traefik/reverse proxy to forward to this application

Deployment cannot continue with port conflict.
```

**Script exits cleanly** - User knows exactly what to do.

---

### Test Case 3: Custom Port (8080)

```bash
sudo ./deploy.sh

# Prompts:
Enter Nginx public port [80]: 8080
Enter Gunicorn internal port [8000]: 8000

# Output:
Starting and enabling all services...
Checking for port conflicts on port 8080...
✓ Port 8080 is available
✓ Nginx service is running
[... firewall configured for port 8080 ...]
```

---

## Common Port Conflicts

### Ports to Watch:

| Port | Common Services |
|------|----------------|
| **80** | Apache, Nginx, Traefik, Caddy, Python SimpleHTTPServer |
| **443** | Apache (SSL), Nginx (SSL), Traefik (SSL) |
| **8000** | Django runserver, other Python apps |
| **8080** | Tomcat, Jenkins, alternate HTTP services |
| **3000** | Node.js apps, React dev server |

### Detection Commands:

```bash
# Check specific port
sudo lsof -i :80
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :80
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :80

# Check all listening ports
sudo lsof -i -sTCP:LISTEN
sudo ss -tlnp

# Check web server services
systemctl list-units --type=service | grep -E "(nginx|apache|httpd|traefik)"
```

---

## Prevention Best Practices

### 1. Clean System Before Deployment

```bash
# Stop common web servers
sudo systemctl stop nginx apache2 httpd traefik caddy 2>/dev/null

# Disable auto-start if not needed
sudo systemctl disable apache2 2>/dev/null
```

### 2. Plan Infrastructure

- Decide: Direct Nginx OR reverse proxy (Traefik/Caddy)
- Don't run both on port 80
- Use reverse proxy to route to multiple apps

### 3. Use Non-Standard Ports for Development

- Port 80/443: Production only
- Port 8080+: Development/testing
- Easier to avoid conflicts

### 4. Document Server Setup

Keep notes on what services use which ports:
```
Server: vultr-prod-01
- Port 80: Traefik (reverse proxy)
- Port 8080: ZKTeco App (via Nginx)
- Port 8000: Gunicorn (localhost only)
- Port 5432: PostgreSQL (localhost only)
```

## Alternative: Nginx as Upstream Behind Traefik

If you want to keep Traefik:

### Deploy Django on Port 8080:
```bash
sudo ./deploy.sh
# Enter Nginx port: 8080
```

### Configure Traefik:

**Dynamic configuration** (`/etc/traefik/dynamic/zkteco.yml`):
```yaml
http:
  routers:
    zkteco:
      rule: "Host(`zkteco.example.com`)"
      service: zkteco
      entryPoints:
        - web

  services:
    zkteco:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

**Restart Traefik:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart traefik
```

**Access:**
- Via domain: `http://zkteco.example.com` → Traefik → Nginx:8080 → Gunicorn:8000
- Direct: `http://server-ip:8080` → Nginx:8080 → Gunicorn:8000

- ❌ Deployment stops with confusing state

### After Fix:
- ✅ Clear error: "Port 80 is already in use by traefik"
- ✅ Shows exactly what's using the port
- ✅ Provides 3 clear resolution options
- ✅ Prevents Nginx start attempt if port occupied
- ✅ Cleaner exit with actionable information
